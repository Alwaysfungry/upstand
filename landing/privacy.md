# Upstand Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-15

Upstand is a local-first desktop app. We keep privacy simple:

## What data Upstand stores

- Reminder settings (for example interval and language)
- Local activity records (sedentary/standup events)
- Exported files that you explicitly create (CSV/PNG)

## Where data is stored

- Data is stored on your own device only.
- Upstand does not upload your records to our servers by default.

## Network usage

- Core reminder and analytics features work offline.
- This landing page is static and does not set tracking cookies.
- Your hosting provider (for example GitHub Pages) may log standard technical request data such as IP, user agent, and request time.

## Data sharing

- Upstand does not sell personal data.
- Upstand does not share your local activity records with third parties by default.

## Your control

- You can reset daily records from the app.
- You can export your records at any time.
- You can uninstall the app and remove local data files.
